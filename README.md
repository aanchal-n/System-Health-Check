# System Health Check

This is a host system health check program built using Python and Shell Scripting. It can currently test for basic system requirements on a MacOS machine and a Linux machine. 
The system health check is majorly divided into three halves i.e. The hardware check, The software check and The network check.

1. The hardware check encompases testing for the current cpu usage, memory usage and disk space.
2. The software check hunts for new updates and prompts the user to update their software.
3. The network check pings a basic website to test connectivity.

## Execution

The code can simply be executed by cloning or downloading all the files.
This code is built to be a command line tool.
It can be executed by:

``` python3 system_check.py```
